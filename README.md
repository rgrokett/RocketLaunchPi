# RocketLaunchPi
RocketLaunchPi displays the next space launch from planet Earth on an LCD screen using your Raspberry Pi (including a Pi Zero) ) including the vehicle name, location, status, and date/time of the launch in local time.  If the launch is imminent, it even plays a count down and blast off sound effects. 

NOTE: If you have already built an Earthquake Pi then you have all the hardware necessary for adding RocketLaunchPi . Just skip directly to the Software Install section, below. (See:http://www.instructables.com/id/Earthquake-Pi-Shake-Rattle-Your-Desk/) 

This project retrieves Launch data from the excellent site www.launchlibrary.net via its JSON API interface. It then displays information for the next launch on the LCD screen. Audio effects are played if the launch is imminent.

See RocketLaunchPi.pdf for details.
